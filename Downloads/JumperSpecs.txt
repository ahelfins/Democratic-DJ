Jumper Specs

a) If there is a flower two cells in front of the jumper, the flower is removed from the Grid and the jumper lands there. 
If there is a rock two cells in front of the jumper but the space in front is empty, the jumper moves to the empty space in front (instead of moving two spaces). 
If there is a rock two cells in front but the space in front has a flower, the jumper moves to the space with the flower, removing the flower.
If there are rocks in both spaces in front of the jumper, the jumper turns 90 degrees clockwise. 

b) If the location two cells in front of the jumper is out of the grid, the jumper tries to move to the space in front of it and if that space is occupied by a non-flower actor, it turns 90 degrees clockwise. 
The entire grid, excluding the locations of the jumper and other non-flower actors, is filled with flowers. If the grid is unbounded, fill with flowers in a square of length 11 (5 flowers above, below, left and right of jumper location).

c) If the jumper is facing the edge of the grid, it turns 90 degrees clockwise. 
The entire grid, excluding the locations of the jumper and other non-flower actors, is filled with flowers. If the grid is unbounded, fill with flowers in a square of length 11 (5 flowers above, below, left and right of jumper location).

d) If there is another actor that is not a rock or a flower two cells in front of the jumper, the jumper moves one forward to the cell in front of it (if that cell is occupied, turn 90 degrees clockwise). 
The actor is surrounded by flowers in all empty locations around the actor, or locations that currently have flowers. 

e) If there is another jumper one or two cells in front of this jumper, both jumpers are removed from the Grid immediately. 

f) No.
